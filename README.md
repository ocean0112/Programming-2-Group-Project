# Programming-Group-Project
Project Checkin 1
Issues fixed: 
  •	Backup Policy is in place and being used.
    o	 A backup was saved on to OneDrive and my hardware.
  •	Standard Unit Testing used
    o	All parts of the code were tested and functional
  •	Physical Security of actual computer code is stored on is adequate
    o	Mulitipe backups are in place incase Github goes offline. The laptop I am using has a password as well.
Things that need to be worked on
  •	Security Testing used (the type varies)
    o	Priority: high
    o	Implement a form of security testing
  •	Third-Party libraries used in code are up-to-date and have been checked to ensure no security issues exist.
    o	Priority: high
    o	Check if code form third party libraries are up to date
  •	Accounting: Logging is integrated into the code itself (for exceptions, errors, and user input failures at minimum)
    o	Priority: high
    o	Integrate logging into code
